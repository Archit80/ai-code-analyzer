Objectives of the Review:
Identify Issues – Detect bugs, anti-patterns, and poor practices
Suggest Improvements – Recommend cleaner, more efficient, or more idiomatic solutions.
Performance & Scalability – Highlight any bottlenecks or unnecessary overhead.
Code Quality – Evaluate readability, structure, naming conventions, modularity, and comments or documentation.
Security (if relevant) – Identify insecure code, hardcoded secrets, or potential vulnerabilities.
Maintainability & Extensibility – Assess how easy the code is to understand, modify, and scale.
Testability – Comment on how well the code supports unit and integration testing.
Review Mindset:
Approach the code like you're working with a high-performing engineering team. Be direct but constructive. Back up your suggestions with reasons. When applicable, offer multiple alternatives with a brief discussion of trade-offs.

# 🧠 AI Code Review Summary

## 🔍 **Issues Found**

### 1. ***Unused Variable***
\`\`\`js
const foo = 42;
\`\`\`
- \`foo\` is declared but never used.
- Dead code hurts readability and bundle size.  
🛠 **Fix:** Remove it if unnecessary.

---

### 2. ***Missing Semicolon***
\`\`\`js
console.log("Hello world")
\`\`\`
- Semicolons are optional in JS but recommended.  
🔧 **Fix:**
\`\`\`js
console.log("Hello world");
\`\`\`

---

## ✅ **Suggestions**

- ✔ Use \`const\` for variables that don't change.
- ✔ Avoid \`var\` like your code depends on it (because it does).
- ✔ Add comments for complex logic.
- ✔ Use \`===\` instead of \`==\` for strict comparison.

---

## 🧼 **Cleaned Up Code**
\`\`\`js
const message = "Hello world";

function greet() {
  console.log(message);
}

greet();
\`\`\`

---

> 💡 ***Pro Tip:***  
> Use \`whitespace-pre-wrap\` in your CSS if you're rendering this Markdown in React, so line breaks are respected.
